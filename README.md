# Dongli-Teahouse

This is a clumsy diary manage system based on tkinter. Maybe I will remake it using C++.

Remember to put the tkdnd2.9.2 library folder into C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Pythonxx\tcl\.

There is an U-Protect check, you could turn it off in the code.

In the raw_user_setting, you should fill in your settings. If in the line 4 you end up with "diary_file_path=./data/data1.dlcw", you should put your encrypted diary file "data1.dlcw" in the folder nameed "data".

After completing the raw_user_setting, you should encrypt it with and rename the output file(encrypted_file.dlcw) as "user_setting"(doesn't have extension!).

The encryption box, which can be opened by placing the cursor on Holo's right ear, and press ctrl+shift+k. The password can be generate(detacted) from the raw_user_setting, or just type your password if you just want to encrypt or decrypt other file.
